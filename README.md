# Shaali E-commerce

Shaali E-commerce is an in-progress Django storefront for premium Indian ethnic fashion. The project currently provides the backend foundation for accounts, categories, subcategories, products, and a session-based shopping cart. The customer-facing frontend, checkout flow, and production configuration are still under development.

## Project Status

This repository is an early-stage application, not a production-ready store.

Implemented:

- Django project and application structure
- Custom email-based user model
- Registration, login, and POST-only logout views
- Category and subcategory models and Django Admin configuration
- Product model and Django Admin configuration
- Session-based cart and cart-item models
- Add-to-cart and cart-total calculation logic
- SQLite development database configuration
- Static and media file configuration

Partially implemented:

- Store and category product filtering
- Product-detail view
- Cart display
- Django template integration

Not implemented:

- Product-to-subcategory relationship and filtering
- Cart quantity update and item removal
- Search and pagination
- Order and checkout models
- Payment processing
- Transactional email
- Automated tests
- Production deployment configuration

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.12
- Django 6.1
- SQLite for local development
- Pillow for image fields
- Django templates, CSS, and JavaScript for the current integrated-frontend direction

Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt`.

## Architecture

The current application is a Django monolith:

```text
Browser request
    -> Django URL resolver
    -> Django view
    -> Django ORM
    -> SQLite
    -> Django template
    -> HTML response
```

Django ORM queries are used throughout the project. No handwritten SQL is currently required.

The repository also contains React-style static design prototypes in `ecommerce/templates/app.js`. They use React from a CDN and hardcoded data, and they are not connected to the Django models, authentication, cart, or URL routing. Treat them as visual references until a final frontend architecture is selected.

## Repository Structure

```

## Domain Model

### Account

`accounts.Account` is the configured `AUTH_USER_MODEL`.

Important characteristics:

- Email is the login identifier.
- Username and email are unique.
- New users are created through `RegistrationForm`.
- Registered users are currently activated immediately.

### Category and SubCategory

`category.Category` contains the category name, slug, description, and optional image.

`category.SubCategory` belongs to a category through `category`. Subcategory slugs are unique within each category, enforced by a database constraint.

The intended initial hierarchy is:

```text
Sarees
|-- Banarasi
|-- Kanjipuram
|-- Organza
|-- Maheshwari
|-- Georgette
|-- Modal
|-- Cotton
`-- Kota Doria
```

### Product

`store.Product` currently belongs directly to a category and contains:

- Product name and slug
- Description and color
- Integer price
- Product image
- Boolean `stock` field
- Availability flag
- Created and modified timestamps

Products do not yet have a `subcategory` foreign key.

The `stock` field is currently boolean. If inventory quantities are required, replace it with a non-negative integer through a migration.

### Cart and CartItem

`carts.Cart` is identified by the Django session key. `carts.CartItem` joins a cart to a product and stores quantity and active state.

The database prevents duplicate product rows within the same cart. Adding an existing product increments its quantity. `CartItem.subtotal` calculates `product.price * quantity`.

The current cart view calculates the total value and total quantity, but its template path and template context integration are intentionally unfinished while the frontend direction is being decided.

## Current Routes

Routes currently connected by `ecommerce/urls.py`:

| URL | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `home` | Placeholder home page with available products in context |
| `/admin/` | Django Admin | Content and account administration |
| `/accounts/register/` | `accounts:register` | Account registration |
| `/accounts/login/` | `accounts:login` | Account login |
| `/accounts/logout/` | `accounts:logout` | POST-only logout |
| `/store/` | `store` | Project-level placeholder store view |
| `/carts/` | `cart` | Cart summary view |
| `/carts/add_cart/<product_id>` | `add_cart` | Add or increment a product |

`store/urls.py` defines catalog routes, but it is not currently included by the root URL configuration. Therefore its category and product-detail routes are not reachable.

Recommended final route design:

```text
/store/
/store/category/<category_slug>/
/store/category/<category_slug>/<subcategory_slug>/
/store/product/<category_slug>/<product_slug>/
```

Explicit `category/` and `product/` prefixes prevent subcategory and product routes from competing for the same two-slug URL pattern.

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Divo15/Shaali-E-commerce.git
cd Shaali-E-commerce
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS or Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Apply migrations

```powershell
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create an administrator

```powershell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

The custom user manager asks for first name, last name, email, username, and password.

### 6. Run the development server

```powershell
python manage.py runserver
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` for the site and `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` for Django Admin.

## Useful Development Commands

```powershell
python manage.py check
python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run
python manage.py showmigrations
python manage.py test
python manage.py runserver
```

The committed SQLite database, uploaded media, collected static files, virtual environments, and environment files are excluded by `.gitignore`. Each developer must run migrations and create their own local data.

## Frontend State

The frontend is currently mixed and should be consolidated before significant UI work continues.

- `home.html` and `store/store.html` are placeholders.
- `register.html` uses a real Django form and static-file tag.
- Several root templates are static React CDN prototypes.
- Prototype navigation uses relative `.html` links instead of Django named URLs.
- Prototype product and cart data is hardcoded.
- Some Django views reference template paths that do not currently exist.

For an integrated Django frontend, the recommended structure is:

```text
ecommerce/templates/
|-- base.html
`-- includes/
    |-- header.html
    `-- footer.html

store/templates/store/
|-- product_list.html
`-- product_detail.html

accounts/templates/accounts/
|-- login.html
`-- register.html

carts/templates/carts/
`-- cart.html
```

Use Django template inheritance, `{% static %}`, `{% url %}`, and server-rendered context data. Small JavaScript components can be added for interactions without separating the frontend.

If the project later adopts Next.js or standalone React, keep Django as the backend and expose the existing domain through Django REST Framework. The models, migrations, admin configuration, and most business rules can remain; the Django page views and templates would be replaced or supplemented by API endpoints.

## Known Issues

These issues are present in the current code and should not surprise the next developer:

1. `/store/` is routed to `ecommerce.views.store`, so `store.views.store` is bypassed.
2. `store/urls.py` is not included in the root URL configuration.
3. `Category.get_urls()` reverses a route that is not currently connected and should be renamed to `get_url()`.
4. `SubCategory.get_url()` expects a `store` namespace and subcategory route that do not exist.
5. `Product.get_url()` expects a product-detail route that is not currently connected.
6. `store.views.product_detail()` ignores `product_slug` when querying and can return the wrong product or raise `MultipleObjectsReturned`.
7. `store.views.product_detail()` references `store/product_detail.html`, which does not exist.
8. `carts.views.cart()` builds a context dictionary but does not pass it to `render()`.
9. `carts.views.cart()` references `store/cart.html`, while the existing prototype is `ecommerce/templates/cart.html`.
10. `carts.views.add_cart()` raises a server error for an invalid product ID instead of returning 404.
11. The login template is still a static React prototype and is not wired to the Django login form fields.
12. The configured email setting is named `MAILERS`; Django normally expects `EMAIL_BACKEND` or an `EMAIL_BACKENDS` configuration appropriate to the installed version.
13. All test modules are placeholders and contain no assertions.
14. `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` are development values and are not production-safe.

## Recommended Next Steps

Complete work in this order to avoid building UI on unstable routes:

1. Decide between integrated Django templates and a separate API frontend.
2. Replace the project-level `/store/` view with `include('store.urls')`.
3. Add explicit, non-conflicting catalog URL patterns and a `store` namespace.
4. Add an optional `subcategory` foreign key to `Product` and create its migration.
5. Update the store view to filter by category and subcategory.
6. Correct product-detail lookup using both category and product slugs.
7. Add route, filtering, product-detail, authentication, and cart tests.
8. Consolidate templates around a shared base layout.
9. Finish cart display, update, and remove operations.
10. Design order, order-item, address, checkout, and payment models.
11. Move secrets and environment-specific settings into environment variables.
12. Switch to PostgreSQL and production storage when preparing deployment.

## Validation

At the time of this README update, the following command passes:

```powershell
.\env\Scripts\python.exe manage.py check
```

There are currently no automated tests, so a passing system check does not confirm end-to-end behavior.

## Product Direction

The design brief is stored in `ecommerce/templates/PRODUCT.md`. The intended experience is elegant, celebratory, premium, and culturally rooted, with accessible navigation and strong product imagery for sarees and other occasion wear.

Target WCAG AA contrast, keyboard-friendly navigation, descriptive image alternatives, readable forms, and reduced-motion support.

## Development Notes

- Keep changes focused and create migrations for every model change.
- Run `manage.py check` before committing.
- Add tests alongside new backend behavior.
- Do not commit the virtual environment, local database, uploaded media, collected static files, or secrets.
- Prefer Django ORM queries over raw SQL unless profiling demonstrates a specific need.
- Preserve the existing custom user model; changing `AUTH_USER_MODEL` after migrations is expensive.
- Explain architectural changes before implementing them when collaborating with the project owner.
